# Grading for py4web de Alfaro Assignments

Every assignment has a source version, which is private to instructors and used to develop the grading, and a student version, which is shared with students. 

## Grading

There are two steps in grading an assignment: downloading it, and grading it. 

The package accesses Google Drive; you need to have this credentials.json file. Please do not share it. If it leaks, it does not grant anyone access to anybody elseâ€™s Drive, but it still uses resources from a cloud project that is not for public use. 
Downloading an assignment
 python download_submissions.py -s <sheets_id> -d <submission_folder>

where: 

sheets_id is the ID of the google sheets corresponding to the submissions form.  If the URL of the sheet is: 

`https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/something/edit`

then the ID is the `something` portion. 

submission_folder is the directory where you want the result to be stored.  There will be one folder per student, named student@ucsc.edu (with student replaced by the student actual email id), with in it already unzipped, the student submission. 

The download code has many options; feel free to explore them. 

Grading an assignment
To grade an assignment, do: 

```
python grade_submissions.py -d submission_folder -g ../assignment1-source/grade 
```

In other words, 
* `-d` is the folder where the submissions are, 
* `-g` is the path to the grading file in the source assignment, not in the student assignment (students can tamper with it). 

The result will be a grades.csv file in the submissions folder. 

## Uploading grades

This can be done with the [py-canvas](https://github.com/edulinq/py-canvas) package. 
A sample command line is: 

```
python3 -m canvas.cli.assignment.upload-scores --config <path_to_config.json> --course <course_number> <assignment_number> path/to/grades.csv --skip-rows 1
```

You can get the assignment number by listing the assignments, via: 

```
python3 -m canvas.cli.assignment.list --config <path_to_config.json> --course <course_number>
```
